# *ProductGroups* are used for creating and managing sets of products.
# Product group can be either anonymous(adhoc) or named.
#
# Anonymous Product groups are created by combining product scopes generated from url
# in 2 formats:
#
#   /t/*taxons/s/name_of_scope/comma_separated_arguments/name_of_scope_that_doesn_take_any//order
#   */s/name_of_scope/comma_separated_arguments/name_of_scope_that_doesn_take_any//order
#
# Named product groups can be created from anonymous ones, lub from another named scope
# (using ProductGroup.from_url method).
# Named product groups have pernament urls, that don't change even after changes
# to scopes are made, and come in two types.
#
#   /t/*taxons/pg/named_product_group
#   */pg/named_product_group
#
# first one is used for combining named scope with taxons, named product group can
# have #in_taxon or #taxons_name_eq scope defined, result should combine both
# and return products that exist in both taxons.
#
# ProductGroup#products returns chain of named scopes generated from order and
# product scopes. So you can do counting, calculations etc, on resulted set of products,
# without retriving all records.
#
# ProductGroup operates on named scopes defined for product in Scopes::Product,
# or generated automatically by Searchlogic
#
